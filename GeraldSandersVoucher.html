           The Gerald Sanders Memorial Voucher for Transcendence in Turbulence is an award bestowed on a composer deemed thoughouly confusing by the New Confusion board of directors. The voucher was concieved by the late Gerald Sanders as a way to get composers exited about the new confusion movement.  In his memory, I, Barnibus Appleton, we award a voucher to the composer who can sew the most chaos with their score.  The first <b>Call for Confusion</b> will progress as follows:

           <li>If a work has never been performed, it will have a 25% chance of being juried.  If it has been performed more than 1 time, but less than 3 times, it will have a 75% chance of being judged. If the piece has been performed over 10 times please do not submit to this call for confusion.</li>
           <li>
           If electronics are used in a work, the composer must provide all of the equipment and also backup equipment.  This includes speakers, cables, laptops, interfaces, microphones, microphone stands, microphone clips, and generators.

            About the New Confusion Ensemble
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text>
            The New Confusion Ensemble is a modular group of performers that regularly features viola, hyperbass flute, citole, finger cymbals, and fixed electronics.  As the director Barnibus Appleton, disperses the New Confusion Ensemble away from his guidance and allows the performers to experience true confusion through conflicting instruction, arbitrary and intermitant conducting, and inconsistant rehearsal times.  The New Confusion Ensemble is never the same for any rehearsal.  This is by design to maximize player confusion.  
                
                
            <br><br>All hyperbass flutes must be provided by composers.
