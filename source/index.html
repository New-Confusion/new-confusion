Sanders found the proportional notation in this piece to be particularly confusing and was inspired by its genius. In the last years of his life, Sanders started the bianual New Confusion Symposium in 2013. He chaired the Symposium until 2016 when he passed away in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.",

After studying with various composers around Europe, Anton Miller returned to his home in Colorado Springs to re-invent his compositional style.  Using his recent studies as inspiration, Miller decided in order for his music to express itself fully, it must draw upon his limited visual art skills.  His scores have been lauded as an impitus for creative performance and as a wonderful source of befuddlement. Relitivly new to the New Confusion Movement, Miller is a rising star who attended the 2017 New Confusion Symposium in Fayetteville, Arkansas and plans to continue going to New Confusion events."  ,
